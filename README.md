#  Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of a retail company using the Superstore dataset.  
The goal is to understand sales trends, profitability, customer segments, and regional performance.

The analysis is performed using **SQL for data extraction and transformation**, and **Tableau for data visualization**.

##  Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze sales and profit evolution over time
- Identify the most and least profitable regions
- Determine top-performing and underperforming products
- Understand customer segment profitability

---

##  Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Tableau (Data Visualization)
- Superstore dataset

##  Key Analyses

### 1. Sales & Profit Evolution Over Time
A time series analysis was performed to observe trends in sales and profit over months and years.

Insight: Helps identify growth trends and seasonal patterns.

---

### 2. Regional Performance Analysis
A geographic analysis was conducted to identify the most and least profitable regions and states.

- Profit distribution by region
- State-level performance using a map visualization

Insight: Profit is concentrated in specific regions, while others show weaker performance.

---

### 3. Product Performance Analysis
Products were ranked based on profitability:

- Top 5 most profitable products
- Bottom 5 least profitable (loss-generating) products

Insight: A small number of products generate most of the profit, while some products create losses.

---

### 4. Customer Segment Analysis
Customer segments were analyzed based on total profit contribution.

- VIP
- Premium
- Standard

Insight: One segment dominates overall profitability.
